# Install
## Pre-configuration
        - make sure that g++ compiler is pre-installed
        - if it is a Linux/Mac Machine, please copy and paste \platform_dependent\linux\Runtimecounter.h to the \main\ directory. If it is a Windows Machine, please copy and paste \platform_dependent\windows\Runtimecounter.h to the \main\ directory.
## Compile
        - Enter into each directory, and type make to compile the soure codes to obtain the executable files.
        - Start with test scripts is a good option to make sure everything is well configured.

# Input and Output

## Input

Input is a directory of graph files. Each graph file is formatted as follows:

The first line is number of nodes, and starting from the second lins is the adjacence list of each node formated as follows:

node_id,degree_d:neighboreid1,weight1:neighborid2,weight2:...neighboridd,weightd

Note that the node_id is within the range [0,n-1], where n is number of nodes, and the list of neighbors are sorted in ascending order too.

An example of input graph file is as follows:

3

0,2:1,1.0:2,1.0

1,2:0,1.0:2,1.0

2,2:0,1.0:1,1.0

where this graph is a triangle with three vertices, and each edge is with weight 1.0.

## Output

Output is a directory of embedding files. Each embedding file is formatted as follows:

The first line is number of nodes, and starting from the seond line is the sparse encoding of latent positions of each node:
node_id,number_non-zero:index1,weight1:index2,weight2:...index_d,weightd

Each index gives the non-zero index of each dimension, and each weight gives the non-zero position for that dimension.

Note that the node_id is within the range [0,n-1], where n is number of nodes, and the indexes are sorted in ascending order too.

## Format Script Usage
   
   To facilitate the usage of the code, we provide a set of format script that transforms different graph formats into input formats of program:
   
   edge2wstandard
   Transforms the edge format into the input weighted standard format of program
   
   For the edge formatï¼Œ each line encodes an edge of graph with format:
   
   source_id[]target_id, it can be sepearted by either whitespace or tab
   
   Both the source_id and target_id is using C-index (i.e., Integer starts from 0)
   
   Usage: edge2wstandard [edgegraphfile] [number_of_nodes]
   
   
   matlab2wstandard
   TSV2wstandard
